    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of
        these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of California,
        without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law.</span></p>
    <h4 class="c9" id="h.p1umasd3s9m3"><span class="c1">17. &nbsp;Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</span></h4>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and we agree to arbitrate any controversy,
        claim or dispute arising out of or in any way related to your use of the Services, including but not limited to
        claims based on contract, tort, negligence, statutory or regulatory provisions. EACH PARTY IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT
        TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE ANY CONTROVERSY, CLAIM OR DISPUTE HEARD BY A JUDGE OR JURY.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">YOU AND WE EXPRESSLY AGREE TO ARBITRATE ANY CONTROVERSY, CLAIM OR DISPUTE ARISING OUT
        OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ALSO APPLIES TO THRESHOLD
        ARBITRABILITY ISSUES, INCLUDING ISSUES RELATED TO WHETHER THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IS UNCONSCIONABLE OR
        ILLUSORY AND ANY DEFENSE TO ARBITRATION. YOU ALSO AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION MAY ONLY BE BROUGHT IN YOUR AND OUR
        INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, NOT AS A CLASS, PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT
        CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY&rsquo;S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A
        REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">The mutual promise by you and us to arbitrate any and all disputes, and to do so on an
        individual basis, rather than to litigate before the courts or other bodies, provides the mutual consideration for
        this agreement to arbitrate.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Either party may exercise the right to arbitrate by providing the other party with
        written notice of any and all claims forming the basis of such right in sufficient detail to inform the other
        party of the substance of such claims. In no event shall the request for arbitration be made after the date when
        institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such claims would be barred by the applicable statute of
        limitations.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5">Unless you and we otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county
        where you reside by a single neutral arbitrator and in accordance with the then-current rules for resolution of
        disputes of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) (available online at
        </span><span class="c5 c8"><a class="c17" href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;or
        by calling 1-800-778-7879). The parties are entitled to representation by an attorney or other
        representative of their choosing. The parties agree to abide by and perform any award rendered by the arbitrator.
        The arbitrator shall issue the award in writing and therein state the essential findings and conclusions on which
        the award is based. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Payment of all
        filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&#39;s rules.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">If this arbitration clause is held unenforceable or arbitration is for any other reason
        not available, any disputes under this Agreement shall be heard in a court of competent jurisdiction in San
        Francisco, California.</span></p>
    <h4 class="c9" id="h.mvqqscxvxxj6"><span class="c1">18. &nbsp;General Terms</span></h4>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c5">You are an independent contractor and nothing contained herein shall create an
        employment or agency relationship, a joint venture, or a partnership. No failure to enforce these Terms shall
        constitute a waiver of any provision contained herein. To the extent any portion of these Terms is determined to
