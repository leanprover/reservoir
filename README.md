# Reservoir

Reservoir is the package repository for Lean and Lake. It automatically indexes about the Lean repositories published on GitHub, builds them on new toolchain releases, and presents the results in organized form on the [website](https://reservoir.lean-lang.org).

## Credits

Thank Yakov Pechersky for [originally suggesting](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/.5BRFC.5D.20package.2Elean.20rename/near/254941424) the name and Xubai Wang for his work on [a similar project](https://github.com/xubaiw/Reservoir.lean). The site's design is heavily inspired by Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io) and uses some open imagery:

* The [Reservoir logo](/site/public/favicon.svg) is the dam from [Icon8's flat icons](https://github.com/icons8/flat-Color-icons).
* The [leaking barrel error page icon](/site/assets/barrel-leak.svg) is by Delapoute from [Game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net/1x1/delapouite/barrel-leak.html) with its colors thematically adjusted for Reservoir.
