# Reservoir

Reservoir is the new, **work-in-progress** package repository for Lean and Lake. It automatically indexes about the Lean repositories published on GitHub, builds them on new toolchain releases, and presents the results in organized form on the [website](https://reservoir.lean-lang.org).

Thank Yakov Pechersky for [suggesting](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/.5BRFC.5D.20package.2Elean.20rename/near/254941424) the name and Xubai Wang for his work on [a similar project](https://github.com/xubaiw/Reservoir.lean). The site design is heavily inspired by Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io) and the Reservoir logo comes from [Icon8's flat icons](https://github.com/icons8/flat-Color-icons).
